Rokkitt is designed from the font forms of a number of distinctive geometric slab serifs, sometimes called 'Egyptians', of the late nineteenth and early - mid twentieth century. Rokkitt is designed specifically as a display font for headings and headlines, though it can also be usefull as an alternative to sans serif text fonts.
